# DreamlerPhone

### Xamarin Forms project porting a project managment tool.

My first Xamarin project.

A proof of concept for using Xamarin Forms to port the main product of Dreamler to mobile platforms.

It was very challanging and I felt a lot of pressure because there was no other developer in the company with experience in Xamarin.

Eventually I delivered a working prototype that could communicate and authenticate with the server, to fetch projects for the current user and presented them in a list.
