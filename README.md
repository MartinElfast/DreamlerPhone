# DreamlerPhone

### A proof of concept for using Xamarin to port the main product of Dreamler to mobile platforms.

If you are just taking a look a good place to start is DreamlerPhone/DreamlerPhone/Pages/LoginPage.cs

Note to reader: This was my first/learning Xamarin project and there was no other developer in the company with experience in Xamarin.
